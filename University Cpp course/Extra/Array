Array is placed in contiguous memory locations that can be accesed by
adding a unique quantifier.

Array is declared by adding a quantity of variables in square brackets 
after array name variable.

To access array variables: arrayvariable[address];
To assign a value: arrayvariable[address] = newValue; // arrayvariable[4] = arrayvariable[0]

Always initialize the arrayvariables!
